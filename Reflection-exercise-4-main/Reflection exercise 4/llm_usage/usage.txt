Analysis of Ratio Estimators and State Respondent Counts
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing respondent counts in U.S. states using a ratio estimator approach. The method relies on data from the 2022 ACS PUMS dataset, specifically examining doctoral degree holders to estimate the total population in each state. California serves as a reference state for the analysis.
Contents
The repository contains the following files:
Reflection-exercise-4.qmd: A Quarto file containing the analysis and detailed explanations of the methodology.
README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for replicating the analysis.
Note: The PDF file is for internal reference and will not be included in the final submission.
Instructions for Data Preparation
To replicate this analysis, follow these steps to obtain and prepare the data:
Visit the IPUMS USA website.
Create an account or log in if you already have one.
Select the ACS 2022 sample:
Go to "SELECT SAMPLES."
Choose ACS 2022 and click "SUBMIT SAMPLE SELECTIONS."
Select variables:
From the "HOUSEHOLD" tab, add "STATEICP" under "GEOGRAPHIC."
From the "PERSON" tab, add "SEX" under "DEMOGRAPHIC" and "EDUC" under "EDUCATION."
View the data cart and click "CREATE DATA EXTRACT," then "SUBMIT EXTRACT."
Download the data once it is processed and save it as usa_00003.csv in your working directory.
Methodology
The ratio estimator calculates the total number of respondents in each state using the following formula:
mathematica
复制代码
Estimated Total Respondents in State = (Doctoral Count in State) / (Doctoral/Total Ratio for California)

The analysis uses California's data as a benchmark, leveraging the ratio of doctoral degree holders to the total respondents.
The results are compared to the actual respondent counts using the dataset weights.
Key Features
Implementation in R, leveraging libraries such as dplyr and tibble.
Detailed comparison of estimated and actual counts, including percentage errors.
Analysis of discrepancies arising from demographic variations, sampling weights, and state-specific characteristics.
How to Run the Code
Ensure that usa_00003.csv is saved in your working directory.
Open and run the Reflection-exercise-4.qmd file in Quarto to reproduce the analysis.
Review the output tables and visualizations for insights.

Let me know if you'd like further refinements!

# Analysis of Ratio Estimators and State Respondent Counts

## Overview
This project explores the use of ratio estimators to analyze respondent counts across U.S. states using the 2022 ACS PUMS dataset. California is used as the reference state to estimate the total population of respondents in other states based on the ratio of doctoral degree holders to the total population. The analysis includes code and results comparing these estimates to the actual respondent counts.

## Structure
The repository includes the following files:
- **Reflection-exercise-4.qmd**: A Quarto file containing the complete analysis and methodology.
- **Reflection-exercise-4.pdf**: A detailed report summarizing the analysis, methodology, and results.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview, repository structure, and LLM usage details.

## LLM Usage
The analysis incorporates the use of language models (LLMs) to assist with:
- Drafting the initial README file and documentation.
- Refining explanations and improving the clarity of analysis descriptions.
- Generating code snippets for repetitive tasks, ensuring alignment with the project's objectives.
